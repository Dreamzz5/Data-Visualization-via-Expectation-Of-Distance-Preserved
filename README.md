# Data Visualization via Expectation Of Distance Preserved

## Introduction

This Matlab package implements machine learning algorithms in dimension reduction.

It is written purely in Matlab language. There is an external dependency [L-BFGS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited-memory_BFGS) and the faster 
-SVD, which has benn mex by C++ in this package. 

Note: this package requires Matlab R2018b or latter. For easy handle this code, I  recommend  you download [DrtoolBox](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/drtoolbox/).

## Some toy in this demo

```matlab
filenames = {'Circle','two_moon','tree_300','Spiral','three_clusters','DistortedSShape'};
```
